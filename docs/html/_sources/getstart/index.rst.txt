Getting started
===============
Here you will get some more information about how to start with the project, either as a **user** who uses the script to do the actual Factorio updating or as a **contributor** who helps with the development/review of the code.

The common part is the `Installation <install.html>`_.

Then, if you are a **user** can choose the `User guide <userguide.html>`_.

**Contributors** might want to refer to the `Technical guide <techguide.html>`_.
